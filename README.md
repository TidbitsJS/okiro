## System Requirements

- [git](https://git-scm.com)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

All of these must be available in your machine. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

## Setup

> If you want to commit and push your work as you go, you'll want to
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com/TidbitsJS/Ruby-Blog.git
cd Ruby-Blog
npm install
```

After the successful installation, in the project directory run:

```
npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.
